# Linear Regression to understand the factors affecting the demand of Bike Sharing App usage
> Using Linear Regression understand the factors that have lead to increase or deacrese in the demand for bike sharing app.
> Histroic data is used to understand the demand. This is an interpretation of data usecase. 
> Using Linear Regression , the data is trained to understand the correlation between several independent variables and to the demand
> This model is applied on the test data to guage the accuracy of the trained model.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


- What is the background of your project?
The bike sharing company aspires to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    How well those variables describe the bike demands

This understanding will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis : Temperature has hightest influnce on the bike demand
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis : Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist has negative correlation/influence on the bike demand
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis : Fall season has the next positive influence on the bike demand
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis : Windspeed has the next negative crrelation/influence on the bike demand
